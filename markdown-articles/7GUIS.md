7GUIs is a benchmark for usability in GUI programming libraries. Flimflam has its own examples for each of these benchmarks. 

Information about the 7GUIs benchmarks, with examples for other libs, can be found [here](https://github.com/eugenkiss/7guis/wiki). 

These examples can serve as a great way to learn about flimflam and see its advantages.
